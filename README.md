# DRCircularProgress (iOS)

Circular progress view for iOS apps. Compatible with iOS 7 and later, tested under iOS 7 and iOS 8.

## Instalation

You can integrate `DRCircularProgress` with your project using Cocoapods. To do so, you will need to add one of the following lines to your Podfile:

For most recent or development version:

    pod 'DRCircularProgress', :git => 'https://github.com/darrarski/DRCircularProgress-iOS.git'

For specific version:

    pod 'DRCircularProgress', :git => 'https://github.com/darrarski/DRCircularProgress-iOS.git', :tag => 'VERSION_TAG'

Where `VERSION_TAG` you should put tag name for given version (ex. "v1.0.0"). It is recommended to set version explicity instead of using most recent version, as backward compatibility is not warranted.
